# Kubernetes and Docker Guide
This repository aims to provide a comprehensive guide to containerization with Kubernetes and Docker, offering resources and tutorials to help you master these technologies.

## Kubernetes Cluster Structure

```bash
  Cluster
├── Node (Master Node)
│   ├── Control Plane Components (API server, scheduler, etc.)
└── Node (Worker Node)
    ├── Pod
    │   ├── Container
    │   └── Container
    ├── Pod
    │   ├── Container
    └── Pod
        ├── Container

```


### Components Explained

- **Cluster**: The entire Kubernetes environment containing multiple nodes.
- **Node**:
  - **Master Node**: Manages the cluster, handling the control plane components responsible for the overall state and operations of the cluster.
  - **Worker Node**: Runs the application workloads inside pods. Multiple worker nodes can exist in a cluster.
  
- **Control Plane Components**:
  - **API Server**: The front end of the Kubernetes control plane, exposes the Kubernetes API.
  - **Scheduler**: Assigns pods to nodes based on resource requirements and constraints.
  - **Controller Manager**: Manages controllers that handle routine tasks to ensure the desired state of the cluster.
  - **etcd**: A distributed key-value store for storing all cluster data.
  
- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, encapsulates one or more containers.

- **Container**: A lightweight, standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software.

## Container Structure


```bash
Container
├── Application Code
├── Runtime (e.g., Python, Node.js)
├── Dependencies (libraries, frameworks)
├── System Tools (basic utilities)
├── Configuration Files (settings, environment variables)
├── Libraries and Binaries

```

### Components Explained

- **Application Code**: The actual codebase for the application running inside the container.
- **Runtime**: The environment needed to run the application code, such as Python or Node.js.
- **Dependencies**: Libraries and frameworks required by the application to function.
- **System Tools**: Basic utilities and tools available within the container.
- **Configuration Files**: Settings and environment variables necessary for the application’s configuration.
- **Libraries and Binaries**: Additional software packages and binaries needed by the application and its dependencies.
